# Abstract
Emerging technology has transformed the automotive industry in recent years to help create vehicles that are more advanced than ever. For example, the rise of autonomous vehicles is largely due to the advancements in sensors and cameras allowing for the vehicle to map its environment and make decisions accordingly. Many aspects of a vehicles design still can be upscaled to include newer technologies and creating a new innovative system for the secondary controls of a vehicle is the aim of this research. 

Secondary controls can require the driver to temporarily divert their eyes from the road creating unnecessary risk.  Futuristic prototypes created by Audi also show that transport can be turned into a luxury experience with the integration of new technology. A particular Audi prototype contained an infotainment system that was completely digitalised and while in autonomous mode, the chairs reclined, the steering wheel folded into the dash and the pedals sunk into the floor leaving the user with only a screen Infront of them. 

The final system aims to grant the user with the ability to operate the vehicles secondary controls using only hand motions and gestures. This will be done through a webcam implementing machine learning and computer vision libraries to track the user's hand and adjust controls based on its movements. Lastly, hand gesture recognition will help introduce the desired functionality by manipulating the controls based on the gesture used. This artefact fouces on adjusting radio controls. To emulate a vehicle, this artefact will adjust the users system volume controls.
